I am a data scientist with a background in theoretical physics. My current research lies in the field of machine learning applied to advertising with an emphasis on causal inference, mean field game theory and big data statistics. 

While pursuing my Ph.D., I have focused my research on the modified theory of gravity, using large scale hydrodynamic simulation and Bayesian parameter inference.
